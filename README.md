# Hierarchical-clustering-wholesale-customer
This code performs hierarchical clustering on a dataset of wholesale customers. The dataset includes various features such as the amount of milk, grocery items, and other products that a customer purchases.

## Techniques Used
1. Data normalization
2. Dendrogram plot generation
3. Hierarchical clustering with Agglomerative Clustering
4. Running the Code

## To run the code, you will need to have the following packages installed:

```
pandas
matplotlib
sklearn
```
You can install these packages using pip.

## Once you have the necessary packages installed, you can run the code by using the following command:

> python wholesale_customers_clustering.py

## Output
The code will output:

1. A dendrogram plot showing the relationships between the samples and helping to determine the optimal number of clusters
2. A scatter plot visualizing the clusters, with the x-axis representing the amount of milk purchased and the y-axis representing the amount of grocery items purchased.
